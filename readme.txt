This is the easy play version that does not require a USB attached arduino device. It is educatively convenient to see what the program has to offer from just computer key presses and mouse clicks.

The main code from my work is found in two places: in the JS folder's file 'sketch.js'.  I also implemented the libraries p5.js, tone.js. 

To run..., follow these guidelines ... :

Given the necessary TONE.js and p5.js libraries, just launch the projects root folder with VSCODE, setup a server, and view with Firefox/CHROME.

In order to hear background soundtrack audio playback, "the user must press the grave accent key .. (located on the same key as the tilde symbol)". 

IMPORTANT NOTE: when solving a trivia question, just click on the answer option number (from whole numbers '1' on up to '4') box and then press the computer's 'ENTER key' for the answer to get evaluated.
